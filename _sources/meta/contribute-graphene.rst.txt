The *Graphene* toolkit has been released under MIT license and is thus
open for anyone to contribute and improve.

Due to the decentralized nature of development in combination with the
powerful source repository system *git*, anyone is free to contribute to
any graphene-based repository.

Since `Cryptonomex`_ is currently the main contributer, we recommend to
fork off of `their repository hosted at github`_.
