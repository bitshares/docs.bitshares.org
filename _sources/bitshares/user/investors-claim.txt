Claiming your Stake
###################

In order to claim your BTS, you need to look in your bitcoin wallet and
search for transactions the the above mentioned address. The keys that
correspond to the inputs of that transaction are what you need to obtain
your BTS (`FAQ <http://www1.agsexplorer.com/ags101>`).

If you have located the private keys (in wallet import format - WIF),
you can safely import them into your BitShares account using the *Import
Keys* tools in the Wallet Management Console of your BitShares wallet.

If, however, you only have a `wallet.dat` file, you will need to

1. install BitShares 0.9.3
2. create an account in the BitShares 0.9.3 wallet
3. import the `wallet.dat` file into your account
4. :doc:`export a BitShares 2.0 compatible backup file <../migration/howto-exporting-wallet>`
5. :doc:`import the new backup into BitShares 2.0 <howto-importing-wallet>`
6. :doc:`claim you funds from the BitShares 2.0 genesis block <howto-importing-wallet>`
