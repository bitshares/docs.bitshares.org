Privatized BitAssets
********************

Alternatively to regular MPA like the bitUSD, BitShares also offers
entrepreneurs an opportunity to create their own SmartCoins with custom
parameters and a distinct set of price feed producers.

Privatized SmartCoin managers can experiment with different parameters such as
collateral requirements, price feeds, force settlement delays and forced
settlement fees. They also earn the trading fees from transactions the issued
asset is involved in, and therefore have a financial incentive to market and
promote it on the network. The entrepreneur who can discover and market the best
set of parameters can earn a significant profit.  The set of parameters that can
be tweaked by entrepreneurs is broad enough that SmartCoins can be used to
implement a fully functional prediction market with a guaranteed global
settlement at a fair price, and no forced settlement before the resolution date.

Some entrepreneurs may want to experiment with SmartCoins that always trade at
exactly $1.00 rather than strictly more than $1.00. They can do this by
manipulating the forced settlement fee continuously such that the average
trading price stays at about $1.00. By default, BitShares prefers fees set by
the market, and thus opts to let the price float above $1.00, rather than fixing
the price by directly manipulating the forced settlement fee.
