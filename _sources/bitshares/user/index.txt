For End User
############

We would like to introduce most features to the user in a friendly and easy to
understand way in this *User Guide*. Note, that the blockchain itself is capable
of many more things that are not (yet) exposed to the end-user. In the future,
we expect to see many more customized wallets that expose different features to
their users.

For Blockchain "Employees"
##########################

BitShares 2 separates responsibilities and incentives activities that are
beneficial to the network, thus acknowledging different skill sets and
interested community members to have incentives to contribute in the most
appropriate way.

* Witnesses are paid for maintaining the back-bone of the network.
* Committee members are unpaid volunteers that organize the community and propose changes to the network.
* Marketers are paid in referral fees.
* Workers are paid for whatever they propose and do.
* Shareholders are people holding BTS. They can cast a vote and influence the DAC's businesses

Each of the above (except Marketers) requires users to vote for the people,
proposals, and/or changes. Those with sufficient approval will be compensated.

Workers are the "catch all" group where if you have an idea for something that
could improve the network, you can get "paid" by the network to do it.
Organizing meet-ups, developing a new tool or feature for the community, and
maintaining websites and infrastructure (e.g. the mumble server team or linux
distribution) are all examples of things workers may do.
