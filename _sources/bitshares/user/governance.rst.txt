Blockchain Governance
*********************

The blockchain can and needs to be governed by **elected** individuals
and businesses. The so called *committee* (a set of many individuals),
can change blockchain parameters such as block size, block confirmation
time and others. Most importantly, though, they deal with the business
plan of the blockchain and tweak costs and revenue streams (mainly
transaction fees). In contrast to most existing crypto currencies, we
are not hoping for a fee market to grow but instead have the committee
members deal with fine-tuning of the business plan. Fortunately, the
shareholders have the final say to approve the executive committee.

Hence, we see businesses competing for seats in the committee to define
blockchain parameters.

If business ideas requires certain blockchain parameters or a particular
set of fees to be profitable, there are several options:

* Argue with shareholders to approve committee members that vote in
  their favour
* Get elected as committee member by showing that the business is worth
  being available in that particular chain
* Deploy the innovative business idea as a smart contract on the
  blockchain and have the shareholders approve the upgrade in
  combination with *Fee Backed Asset* that pays future fees of the smart
  contract to holders of that asset (:doc:`fba`)
