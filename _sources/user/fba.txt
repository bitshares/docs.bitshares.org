Fee Backed Asset
****************

Existing core features of the BitShares protocol are Market Pegged Assets (MPA)
and issuer backed User Issued Assets (UIA). In this proposal, we introduce
another type of asset: *Fee Backed Assets (FBA)*.

Feed backed assets allow to propose and fund *market based* innovation by
sharing a cut of future profits generated by this particular innovation with the
people that helped fund it. Think of it as a *Kickstarter* for features.
Hence, if people can profit from successful features in the form of fees then it
can help the BitShares ecosystem to become more adaptable over time as it
promotes innovation and can pay for its development.

If you have any features in mind that require new kind of transaction on the
blockchain, you can code that feature and fund it with an FBA.

Feed Backed Assets have been proposed in `BSIP-0007`_.
