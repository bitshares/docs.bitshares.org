* **Security and Control over accounts and funds**:

  unintentionally. With the power to be independent from 3rd parties, comes
  the responsibility to :doc:`protect what belongs to you <security>`.

  With BitShares it becomes possible to interact with people directly without
  needing to go through a middleman.  Hence, BitShares is a platform of free

  Transactions in BitShares are verified and irrevocable in only a few seconds
  time.

* **Decentralized Committee**:
  Decisions that can effect the BitShares ecosystem are made using a on-chain
  committee voted upon by shareholders.  Hence, no single entity can change
  the deal retroactively.

  executed to improve the BitShares business over time and allow to react on
  external influences quickly.
