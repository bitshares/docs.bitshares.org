Witnesses
*********

In BitShares, the witnesses' job is to collect transactions, bundle them into a
block, sign the block and broadcast it to the network. They essentially are the
block producers for the underlying consensus mechanism.

For each successfully constructed block, a witness is payed in shares that are
taken from the limited reserves pool at a rate that is defined by the
shareholders by means of approval voting.

How to run a witness is described in a :doc:`separated tutorial
<../tutorials/witness-howto>`.
