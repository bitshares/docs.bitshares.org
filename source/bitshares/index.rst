BitShares 2.0
*************

BitShares is a technology supported by next generation entrepreneurs, investors, and
developers with a common interest in finding free market solutions by leveraging the power
of globally decentralized consensus and decision making. Consensus technology has the
power to do for economics what the internet did for information. It can harness the
combined power of all humanity to coordinate the discovery and aggregation of real-time
knowledge, previously unobtainable. This knowledge can be used to more effectively
coordinate the allocation of resources toward their most productive and valuable use.

What is BitShares
#################

We have compiled some articles that give a brief overview on how
BitShares started, evolved and why it is where it is today. We recognize
that BitShares has changed significantly over the last years and now
feel confident to have promising and very stable software that will
improve steadily at a pace that partners and customers can follow
easily.

If you are totally new to BitShares and want to get started right away,
we recommend that you take a look at the :doc:`Getting Started
<user/first-steps-users>` guide!
