"BSIP stands for BitShares Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an "
"improvement *protocol*. A BSIP is a design document providing information"
" to the BitShares community, or describing a new feature for BitShares or"
" its processes or environment. The BSIP should provide a concise "
"technical specification of the feature or the idea and a rationale for "
"it. It may not only describe technical improvements but also document "
"*best-practises* and recommendations."

msgid ""
"Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is a new method of securing a crypto-"
"currency's network.  DPOS attempts to solve the problems of both "
"Bitcoin's traditional Proof of Work system, and the Proof of Stake system"
" of Peercoin and NXT. DPOS implements a layer of technological democracy "
"to offset the negative effects of centralization."

msgid "Background"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/bitshares/dpos.rst:10
msgid ""
"Delegated proof of stake mitigates the potential negative impacts of "
"centralization through the use of witnesses (formaly called *delegates*)."
" A total of `N` witnesses sign the blocks and are voted on by those using"
" the network with every transaction that gets made. By using a "
"decentralized voting process, DPOS is by design more democratic than "
"comparable systems. Rather than eliminating the need for trust all "
"together, DPOS has safeguards in place the ensure that those trusted with"
" signing blocks on behalf of the network are doing so correctly and "
"without bias. Additionally, each block signed must have a verification "
"that the block before it was signed by a trusted node. DPOS eliminates "
"the need to wait until a certain number of untrusted nodes have verified "
"a transaction before it can be confirmed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/bitshares/dpos.rst:12
msgid ""
"This reduced need for confirmation produces an increase in speed of "
"transaction times. By intentionally placing trust with the most "
"trustworthy of potential block signers, as decided by the network, no "
"artificial encumbrance need be imposed to slow down the block signing "
"process. DPOS allows for many more transactions to be included in a block"
" than either proof of work or proof of stake systems. DPOS technology "
"allows cryptocurrency technology to transact at a level where it can "
"compete with the centralized clearinghouses like Visa and Mastercard. "
"Such clearinghouses administer the most popular forms of electronic "
"payment systems in the world."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/bitshares/dpos.rst:14
msgid ""
"In a delegated proof of stake system centralization still occurs, but it "
"is controlled. Unlike other methods of securing cryptocurrency networks, "
"every client in a DPOS system has the ability to decide who is trusted "
"rather than trust concentrating in the hands of those with the most "
"resources. DPOS allows the network to reap some of the major advantages "
"of centralization, while still maintaining some calculated measure of "
"decentralization. This system is enforced by a fair election process "
"where anyone could potentially become a delegated representative of the "
"majority of users."

"one of the directors misses their turn, clients will automatically switch"
" their vote away from them. Eventually these directors will be voted off "
"the board and someone else will join. Board members are paid a small "
"token to make it worth their time ensuring uptime and an incentive to "
"campaign. They also post a small bond equal to 100x the average pay they "

"**Abstract**: BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized platform"
" built for high-performance financial smart contracts. The decentralized "
"exchange that allows for trading of arbitrary pairs without counterparty "
"risk facilitates only one out of many available features. Market-pegged "
"assets, such as the bitUSD, are crypto tokens that come with all the "

"BitShares represents the first decentralized autonomous company that lets"

"**Abstract**: Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto released his whitepaper and "
"corresponding software for bitcoin, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has "
"continued to grow at a rapid pace. In the beginning, Bitcoin created a "
"platform that anyone could use to transfer value across the internet "
"without middlemen, banks or counterparty risk. However, once bitcoin's "
"basic blockchain consensus technology became established and stable, "
"people began to discuss whether blockchain technology could also be "
"applied to enable the trade of multiple assets without the need for a "
"broker or centralized clearinghouse. BitShares has created such a "
"technology, and has coined the term \"decentralized exchange\" (DEX) to "
"describe our Bitcoin 2.0 platform. Currently, it supports trade not only "
"in digital assets, but also traditional financial instruments and "
"securities on the blockchain. The two main tools we provide for the "
"creation of these instruments, market pegged assets (MPA) and user-issued"
" assets (UIA), are discussed in detail in this paper."
